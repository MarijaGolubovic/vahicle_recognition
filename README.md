# Vehicle Detection and Classification using SSD and YOLO

In this project, we have trained and compared two models, SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector) and YOLO (You Only Look Once), for the detection and classification of vehicles on Terazije Street in Belgrade.

## Models

We have provided pre-trained models for both SSD and YOLO in the respective folders. Below are the instructions on how to run each model:

### SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector)

1. Navigate to the SSD folder.
2. Follow the instructions in the README file within the SSD folder to set up the environment and dependencies.
3. Use the provided scripts or commands to run the SSD model for vehicle detection and classification.

### YOLO (You Only Look Once)

1. Navigate to the YOLO folder.
2. Refer to the README file within the YOLO folder for setup instructions and dependencies.
3. Utilize the provided instructions or scripts to execute the YOLO model for vehicle detection and classification.

## Folder Structure

- `SSD_Model/`: Contains the pre-trained SSD model and instructions on how to run it.
- `YOLO_Model/`: Includes the pre-trained YOLO model and guidelines for running it.
